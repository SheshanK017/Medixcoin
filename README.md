# MEDICOIN: A Healthcare Innovation Funding Platform

Powered by Next.js, MEDICOIN revolutionizes healthcare funding by enabling stakeholders to participate in lockdrop campaigns for supporting healthcare innovation projects. Leveraging lockdrop CW20 tokens provided by Andromeda, users can deposit native tokens to fund research, development, and implementation of new healthcare technologies or treatments. In return, participants receive CW20 tokens representing investment or usage rights in the projects. The platform serves as a collaborative hub, fostering partnerships between researchers, healthcare providers, investors, and patients to drive innovation and improve healthcare outcomes. With Andromeda's cutting-edge blockchain solutions, the platform ensures secure and transparent transactions, empowering stakeholders to contribute to groundbreaking healthcare initiatives.
